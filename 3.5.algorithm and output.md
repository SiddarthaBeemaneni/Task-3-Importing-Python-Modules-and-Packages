3.5 Print Pattern Based on Input Size

Scenario: Write a Python program to print the following pattern based on input size.

Algorithm:

1. Input an integer n (number of rows).

2. Initialize counter num = 1 to track the current number to print.

3. Loop from i = 1 to n (each row):

   • Print spaces: (n - i) spaces to align the row.

   • Loop from j = 1 to i:

     - Print num and increment it.
   
   • Move to the next line.

   output:

   input:3
   
          1 
         2 3 
        4 5 6
   
   input:4

           1 
          2 3 
         4 5 6 
       7 8 9 10
